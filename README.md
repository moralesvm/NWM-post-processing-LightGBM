### ML post-processing correction model
This repository contains a Python code to post-process NWM retrospective streamflow predictions and improve them using a ML correction model based on a physics-informed LightGBM approach.<be>

* The code is an example to improve the predictions at Sleepers River W5 basin in Vermont, US but a similar approach could be applied to any other site.
