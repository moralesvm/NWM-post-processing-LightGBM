## ML post-processing correction model
This repository contains a Python code to post-process NWM retrospective streamflow predictions and improve them by using a ML correction model based on a physics-informed LightGBM approach.
The code is an example for ti improve the predictions at Sleepers river W5 basin in Vermont, US but a similar approach could be applied to any other site.
